                      In a world of like it, post it, click, share etc. A working knowledge of the internet and how it works is necessary. Every one from the big CEOs to the students by the corner all need the internet. This has led to fast paced  new and innovative ways of using internet resources. Africa however has been on the back pedal in this race, hence Google in line with it's interesting business model kick-started the Google Digital Skills for Africa Training. It's aim is to educate Africans on the need to be internet savvy and how to use that knowledge for economic gains.

                      Owing to the tediousness of medical school and the financial crisis that Nigerians find themselves in, it is pertinent that Medical Students understood and benefited from the massive opportunities that await them online these opportunities range from Academic aids to streams of income. This need led to the organization of a Google Digital Skills for Africa Training session held for members of the Port Harcourt Medical Students Association (PUMSA) through the Office of the Public Relations Officer.

                    "I had a wonderful experience at the Google Digital Skills Taining organized by PUMSA. It  was a very interactive session learning while having fun. The tutor was kind, and she took her time to explain a lot of conceptsconcemed with the digital environment, which most of us were not familiar with. <br> <br>

                    I learnt a lot of new things. I learnt about Digital marketing and its difference as compared to the Traditional marketing. I also learnt about the internet and terms assocated with it such as web browser, web server, the world wide web (www). The tutor also took her time to explore the relevance of learning about the Digital Environment. In all I learnt so many new things that I cannot at this instant write them all. We were also encouraged us to make use of the internet and social media in marketing our products, as it was a cheaper and more reliable way compared to traditional advertising methods. Indeed the  Google Digital Skills Training for Africa is a very wonderful initiative. I look forward to attendig more programs like this."
