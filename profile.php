              We also create and take advantage of different forums that bring the medical student close to the medical doctor both for mentorship and capacity building.
            </p>
            <strong>Outreaches</strong>
            <p>
              We engage in health outreaches to rural communities where we engage in health screening activities, diagnosis and treatment of carry out health education programs. <br>
              Through our online campaigns, radio talk shows and visits to various departments in the school, surrounding communities (schools, markets etc.), we carry out health education and promotion campaigns. <br>
